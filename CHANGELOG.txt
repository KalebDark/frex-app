v1.1.0 (19.08.2012)
    - Removed need to enter a names when saving a fractal
    - Added new "Manage Fractals" screen - a fractal gallery from where you can view, share and delete all of your saved fractals
    - Added new "Settings" screen - users can now enter the number of concurrently working computation tasks
v1.0.2 (10.08.2012)
    - Speeded up display of the initially displayed fractal (omit decorations, because their computation was too slow on older devices)
    - When changing fractal type or decoration mode, color gain is now adapted so that full color gradient range is exploited.
    - When saving a fractal, the fractal type is now used as default name.
    - On some Android 2.3 devices the text of drop-down list items (in Properties & Decorations dialogs) was barely visible. Fixed that.
    - On some Android 2.3 devices the options menu has a white background, but Frex uses white icons... Fixed that.
    - On some Android 2.3 devices orientation changes caused Frex to terminate unexpectedly. Fixed that.
